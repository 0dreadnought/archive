In this scenario:

* Boxes appear at different locations (x,y) of the environment, not always in the same lane of the robots.

* Robots are able to avoid obstacles including other robots, a simple collision avoidance is enough.
* Boxes are collected and dropped in the cell at the top left edge of the grid environment.
