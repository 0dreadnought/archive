# Activity 2

In this activity you need to analyse the architecture implemented and consider alternative architectures:

* Consider the common reference architectures, which one would be closer to the implemented architecture? 

* What would you do to make this architecture closer to a subsumption architecture?

* If you were asked to build a BDI architecture for this problem, what would the components be? i.e. What would the beliefs, desires and intentions of the warehouse robot be?
