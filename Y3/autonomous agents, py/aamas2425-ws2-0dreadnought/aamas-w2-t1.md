# Activity 1

Robots are being used in warehouse to support multiple activities. For example, Amazon uses robots to collect items across the warehouse and bring them closer to the human operators stations. This way the operators do not need to carry heavy load and robots can quickly find the required items across the facilities.

An example of the operation is presented in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox05Bks2Q3s).


In this activity you need to implement a warehouse agent model, simulating a simplified representation of the automated warehouse presented in the video. Boiler plate code is provided and you need to: 

1. Draw a statechart diagram with the possible states of the Robot and their transitions. Create a file called `robot-states` with your diagram.

2. Implement the actions that a warehouse robot is capable of.

3. Implement an agent able to make decisions about what to do in the given scenario.

4. Implement minimal unittest for your agent behaviours.

5. commit and push the resulting source code and statechart diagram.
