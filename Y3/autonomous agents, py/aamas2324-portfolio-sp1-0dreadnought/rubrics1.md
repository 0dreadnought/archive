| Overall Descriptor | | Failed | 3rd | 2:2 | 2:1 | First |
| Basic Operation (20%) | | Design is missing or poorly designed with unclear states and actions; lacks detailed labels, proper connections, and completeness; Simulation does not run; code is unreadable, poorly documented, and disorganised. No unit tests implemented. | Design is present but is basic or cluttered; states, actions, connections, and labels are unclear; lacks completeness; Simulation runs but with frequent errors; code is basic and cluttered; Minimal documentation and organisation is acceptable. Minimal set of unit tests.| Design is present and captures most of the agents' behaviour but a few key aspects are missing; some states, actions, and connections are unclear; some labels are missing; lacks completeness; Simulation runs with a few issues; code is tidy but basic; good documentation and organisation. Some of the expected behaviour is achieved. Few unit tests implemented. | Design is clear, states and actions are identifiable, mostly well labelled, connections are mostly accurate, there are minor omissions or minimal elements that required additional details; Simulation runs with no errors; code is tidy, well documented, and organised. Most of the expected behaviour is achieved but there are minor omissions. Reasonable coverage of unit tests. | Design is tidy and clear, with comprehensive identification of states and actions that are properly connected and labelled; demonstrates strong design principles and professional quality. Great level of detail even meaningfully extending the given information. Simulation runs as per requirements and until completion with no errors. Code is tidy, widely and clearly documented and organised. Code is fully aligned with design ; Complete set of unit tests. |
| Robot Games (10%) | | Solution is missing, unclear or poorly developed; demonstrates little or no understanding of the reference game | Solution is present but is basic or incomplete; showing only a superficial understanding of the reference game and its application to the scenario | Solution is reasonable, but lacks key details; shows a reasonable understanding of the reference game but lacks depth | Solution is clear and complete with moderate details; demonstrates a good understanding of the reference game and the application to the scenario. Good use of figures and tables. | Solution is very clear, detailed, and well-structured at a professional level; demonstrates excellent understanding of the reference game and its application to the scenario. The game proposed is innovative but sensible and the solution provides a strong demonstration of the understanding of the reference game chosen and its application to the scenario . Strong use of figures and tables to support solution. |
