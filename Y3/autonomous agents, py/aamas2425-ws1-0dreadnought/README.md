# AA-MAS - Worksheet 1 

**Date**: 03/Oct/24
 
**Topic**: Introduction to Agent-based Modelling (I)

**Objective**: Learn and practice basic aspects of agent-based modelling as a tool for simulation and design of autonomous agents and multiagent systems.

## Overview

Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a technique that enable to design models and simulations with three main components:

* **Environment**: Where agents live and interact
* **Agents**: Autonomous entities able to make decisions and take actions
* **Interactions**: Different relationships of communication, cooperation, competition, among agents.

Although ABM is used for different purposes, such as modelling of human behaviours, public health policies, among others, it has gained more attention of the AI community as it enables design and evaluation of different decision-making and learning approaches.

We will start installing and learning the basics of a popular ABM simulation tool called [MESA](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Then you will explore one of the earliest  agent-based models proposed and, if you still have time, finish this session attempting to create your own multi-agent based model.
