NISs were started at 2011 as experimental platform for whole Kazakhstan's educational system as its aim is to develop, analyse, implement and realize
modern models of educational programs, while given full autonomy in defining the scoring and learning systems. In my school there are about 700 students at the moment. Despite the fact that my city's NIS 
is math oriented, it provides a lot of opportunities to develop yourself outside school subjects. From simple sports, arts clubs
up to aeroRobotics clubs. Personaly, I was part of my schools dancing anensemble and singing chorus. We participated in lots of 
dancing competitions, where we have never took a prize place less that grand prix, while with chorus I mostly participated on 
school's concerts.
